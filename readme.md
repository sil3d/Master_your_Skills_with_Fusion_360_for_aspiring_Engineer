--- upcoming ---
Project 1: Lego (Using extrude, pattern tool, reproduise images,color,move tool)
o Tools Covered: Sketch, pattern, Fillet, extrude, and text.
o Description: Participants will design a simple lego
Project 2: Pencil (Revolve & Fillet)
o Tools Covered: Sketch, Revolve, Fillet, Appearance.
o Description: Create a basic pencil by revolving a sketch. Add details such as chamfers or fillets at the tip and apply textures to simulate a wooden or colored pencil.
Project 3: Advanced Bottle with texture (Using the Revolve Tool)
o Tools Covered: Sketch, Revolve, Fillet, Shell, and Appearance.
o Description: Participants will design a simple water bottle using the revolve tool to create a symmetrical shape. They will also add thickness using the Shell tool and apply materials.

--- upcoming ---

Project 4: Lounge Chair (Focus on Loft and Sweep)
o Tools Covered: Sketch, Sweep, Loft, Fillet, Mirror.
o Description: Design a lounge chair with organic curves using the Loft tool for smooth transitions and Sweep for rounded arms or legs. Mirror the parts for symmetry.
Project 5: Spiral Vase (Using the Coil and Thread Tools)
o Tools Covered: Coil, Thread, Fillet, Shell, Pattern.
o Description: Participants will create a spiral vase using the Coil and Thread tools, adding thickness with Shell and utilizing patterns to decorate the surface.
Project 6: Assembly, animation,joints
o Tools Covered: Assemble.
o Description: Create a joints system and animate it by using assemble function.

Week 3: Advanced Projects (Patterns, Mirroring, and Surfaces and 3D printing, parametric design, technical drawing)
--- upcoming ---
Project 7: Custom Gear + Servo motor (Using Patterns and Mirror, assembly, technical drawing)
o Tools Covered: Sketch, Extrude, Circular Pattern, Mirror, Thread.
o Description: Design a custom gear with a pattern of teeth and apply thread details. Participants will use the Circular Pattern tool to generate gear teeth and the Mirror tool for symmetrical elements.
o Design a simple robotic gripper
Project 8: Complex Modeling Bike Frame
o Tools Covered: pipe, 3D sketch, combine,inspect,construct
o Description: Model a complex curved surface like an automotive hood or a wing. Use Surface tools for creating and patching organic shapes and curves.
Project 9: Threaded Bolt & Nut (Thread & Coil Tools, technical drawing)
o Use the Thread tool to create a bolt and the Coil tool for springs or other spiraled elements.
o Practice combining multiple tools for detailed parts.

Week 4: Advanced SVG, Image Import, and Form Tools
--- upcoming ---
Project 10: Custom Phone Case (SVG and Emboss)
o Tools Covered: SVG Import, Sketch, Extrude, Fillet, Emboss.
o Description: Import SVG files to design a custom phone case with decorative patterns. Apply the Emboss tool to engrave or emboss patterns and logos onto the case.
Project 11: 3D Model from Image Blueprint (Sketch from Image)
o Tools Covered: Canvas, Sketch, Loft, Sweep, Mirror.
o Description: Participants will import an image blueprint to trace and create a 3D model. Use Loft and Sweep to develop the shapes, and the Mirror tool to ensure symmetry.
Project 12: Furniture Design Using Forms (Form and Surface Tools)
o Tools Covered: Form, Surface tools, Loft, Sweep, Thicken, Fillet.
o Description: Design a complex piece of furniture, like a modern chair, using Form and Surface tools. Shape the furniture with organic curves and refine it with Thicken and Fillet.
